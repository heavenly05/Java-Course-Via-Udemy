a literal is a fixed value that doesnt change during runtime

a variable is a value that can or has changed during runtime

a literal is better for perfomance because the computer doesnt need to ever change how much memory it needs

String a = "hello";  is a fixed value it is a literal.


a = "bye"  is now not fixed during eecution. it is now a variable.
