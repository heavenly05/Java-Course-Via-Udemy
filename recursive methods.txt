recursive methods

recursive methods are  methods that call themselves.it can be done by just calling the method inside the method

public static int add2NumsTwice(int a, int b){
    int result = a + b;

    return result + add2NumsTwice(a, b);
}

System.out.println(2,2)

the result would be 8.
