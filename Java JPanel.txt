JPanel panel = new JPanel

here are some methods of the panel class

.setBackground(color) used to change the background color of a panel

.setBounds(x, y, width, height); used to set the ayout of the panel if there is no layout manager on the window
.add(component) to add components tot he panel like labels


you use frame.add(panel) to add panels to the window

A JLayeredPane is the exact same as a normal panel except that it can position elemnts on top of other elements.

when you add components/elements to a layered pane they will automtically layer themselves, the first element added being placed on top and the others being placed underneath. however when you add a element you can use z indexing to place them.

lpane.add(label, Interger.valueof(0)); that will be placed at the very back higher numbers for it to be closer to the front.
