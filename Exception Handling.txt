Exception Handling

exceptions are unexpected events / errors that happen during runtime that disrupt the normal flow of excecution aka stop your program in the middle of executing code

one way you can handle these exceptions is to use the try and catch and finally method

try{
  //code to try to run
}catch(ErrorType err){
//code to run if the try resulted in an eror/failed
}finally{
//code to run regardless if successfu or erro
}

this will handle errors without stopping your codes

Exception data tpe will catch all exception

you can use mutiple catch statements to address multiple errors
