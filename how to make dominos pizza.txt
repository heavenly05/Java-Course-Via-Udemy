in a large bowl combine
  3 and 3 quaters (3/4) cups of flour

in the big bowl mix the mixture with your hands for about five minutes until you get a smooth dough that doest stick to the side

roll it into a ball, move it into a grease bowl (metal bowl that feels like grease when you run your finger in it kind of like thomases dog bowl)

cover the grease bowl with plastic wrap move it into the fridge overnight or for at least  hours.


this lets the dough rest, it lets it puff up and increase it elasticity making it easier to stretch. it increases the flavor too.

if you want 3 medium pizzas cut it into 3 equal pieces and roll them back into balls.

if not let it stay together 


grease a pan with oil, genorously dust with flower  over the flour set the dough in the pan and cover the pan with another pan.
