how to make pigs in a blanket

in a bowl 

	-add 1 and a quater cup of all purpose flour

	-1 teaspoon fo sugar
	
	-3/4 teaspoon fo salt

mix it up

add in a half cup of milk

add in 1/3 cup of butter


get your hot dogs ready, cut a hot dog into 3 equal parts,

make sure they are dry and poke them with a fork.


make a workspace where you can roll the dough and add flour when necessary until dough it nice and smooth and not sticky



pat it into a recangle

 put on plate cover let rest for 10 minutes.

using whatever you can flatten the rectangle to flatten it out more.



i recommend using the paper towel brown thing and rubbing flower on it like your doing something naughty


once your dough is flat cut them into rectangles about twice as wide as the width of your pig and about as long as your pig in a blanket. "about" it should NOT be exact

roll the pig into the blanket.

pinch the seams to make sure the pigs stay closed

put them on a pan and use a baking sheet.

dont put your pigs too close together or the dough will mix together.

butter them with a a special sauce,

butter, garlic powder, sugar, salt whatever you cn find

let them bake for 15 - 20 minutes and boom food. yum.
