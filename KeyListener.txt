KeyListener


implement the KeyListener interface onto your frame and implement the method public void KeyTyped(KeyEvent e)

KeyPressed

KeyReleased

frame.addKeyListener(frame)

e.getKeyChar() gets the character

e.getKeyCode() gets the number 

label.setLocation(x,y )

label.getX() - 1 to get new numbers same with y








mouse listener







implement MouseLister onto jframe

on components you can use .addMouseListener

mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)

mousePressed

mouseReleased

mouseEntered

mouseExited 

one thing you can do is make a frame implement the MouseListener 

and override the method you want and you can make a component use the frame as a mouse listener because frame is technically now a mouse listener


there is also such thing as a click listener which is a class

also a drag listener
