Java File handling

to import the file class you use import java.io.File.

to use it you go :

File file = new File("filename.txt");

the file name you enter will be the one you will be working with.

i made a java file methods folder that you can read to use if you need it

you can check for files outside of a project folder by specifying the path to the file in the new File() parameters


to write in files you must import the FileWriter class.

import java.io.FileWriter;

FileWriter newFile = new FileWriter("filename.txt");

reccomended you use try and catch bocks when writing a file
Exception for the parameter in catch

i created a file that contains the method for file writer

to read a file in java you must import the FileReader Class

import java.io.FileReader;
FileReader reader = new FileReader("filetoread.txt");
