Java javax JFrame

A JFrame is a GUI window that  you can dd components to.
a JFrame is a class from the swing package.

it has a bunch of predefined methods to help you create a GUI though i dont think this is the oruginal one it seems to be a library/framework and i dont really like that.id rather use the original class for the gui to get more of a feel for it but you can sti use this. 

To use JFrame you must import the class from the swing package.

import javax.swing.JFrame;

JFrame frame = new JFrame(); //creates a frame.

//methods


.setTitle("Title") title of the window by defaut its nothing

.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); by defauld its set to JSFRAME.HIDE_ON_CLOSE it doesnt close it just hides in the background.

.setResizable(false); allows the user to rescale the window by default its true

frame.setSize(420,420); sets the width and heigh of the fame using x and y by default its like 1

frame.setVisible(true); makes the frame visible by defaullt its false

if you want to change the icon image you mustcreate a icon image from the ImageIcon class

import javax.swing.ImageIcon;

ImageIcon image = new ImageIcon("path to image");turns any sized image into a icon

personally i just import everything from the swing class so i can use multiplle classes
frame.setIconImage(image.getImage()) change icon to image

.getContentPane().setBackground(Color.green) you must import the color class before using a color thing using

import java.awt.Color, you can use hex,rgb and more

new Color(0,0,0) or you can put in a hex value

the jframes position and height includes the bar at the top with the x and stuff. so it will always be good to use panels for your components.
