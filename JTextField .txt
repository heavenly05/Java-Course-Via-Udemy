JTextField 

A GUI textbox component that can be used to get set or add text

the first thing you need to set up is the ActionListener interface on your frame/window so that it can listen for keys.

one way is to implement the ActionListener interface on the jframe and override the actionPerformed method from it

import javax.swing.JTextField

JTextField textField = new JTextField()

thats about it really.

you can create a button to submit the text using the .getText method.
