Java Keybinding

keybindings allow you to bind an Action to a keystroke.

it doesnt require you to click a component to focus on it and all swing components have key bindings.

increased flexibility than key listener

 and you can assign key strokes to individual swing componenets 

it is more difficult to utilize and set up
