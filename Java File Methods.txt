Jav File Handling

the File class from the java.io package allow us to work with files.
to use it you must make a file object, 

File myFile = new File("filename.txt); i think this will be the file you pan to work with wheter it be create, edit or eveen deete. it has MANY methods you can use like:

canRead() tests wheter if the file can be read

canWrite() tests wheter the file can be wrote

createNewFile() creates an empty file.

delete() deletes a file

exists() tests wheter the file exists

mkdir() makes a new folder/directory

everything above returns true if the operationw as succesfu or not

getName() returns the file name of the fie

getAbsolutePath() {returns the absolute pathname of the file

length() returns othe size of the file

list() returns an array of file in the direectory

theres a FileWriter class that has a write() method to write text to a file. when done writing to file you use the .close() method
