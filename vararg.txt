In Java, the ... (three dots) is used to denote varargs (variable-length argument lists) in method parameters. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means:

Varargs (Variable-Length Argument Lists):
When you see ... in a method parameter, it indicates that the method can accept zero or more arguments of the specified type.
It‚Äôs particularly useful when you want to create a method that can handle an arbitrary number of arguments without explicitly specifying each one.
Here‚Äôs how it works:
Java

public void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
    for (int num : numbers) {
        System.out.print(num + " ");
    }
}

Example Usage:
Suppose we call the printNumbers method like this:
Java

printNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
The numbers parameter inside printNumbers will be treated as an array of integers containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The method will then iterate through this array and print each number.
Other Use Cases:
Varargs are commonly used in methods like printf in Java‚Äôs System.out class, where you can pass a variable number of arguments to format a string.
For example:
Java

System.out.printf("Hello, %s! Your age is %d.%n", "Alice", 30);

Remember, the ... syntax is a powerful tool for creating flexible methods that can handle varying numbers of arguments. üöÄ



A method can have ‚Äúnormal‚Äù parameters along with a variable-length parameter. 
However, the variable-length parameter must be the last parameter declared by the 
method. For example, this method declaration is perfectly acceptable:
int doIt(int a, int b, double c, int ... vals) {
In this case, the first three arguments used in a call to doIt( ) are matched to the first three 
parameters. Then, any remaining arguments are assumed to belong to vals.
Remember, the varargs parameter must be last. For example, the following declaration 
is incorrect:
int doIt(int a, int b, double c, int ... vals, boolean stopFlag) { // Error!
Here, there is an attempt to declare a regular parameter after the varargs parameter, which 
is illegal.
There is one more restriction to be aware of: there must be only one varargs parameter. 
For example, this declaration is also invalid:
int doIt(int a, int b, double c, int ... vals, double ... morevals) { // Error!
The attempt to declare the second varargs parameter is illegal.
Here is a reworked version of the vaTest( ) method that takes a regular argument and a
