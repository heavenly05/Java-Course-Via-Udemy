Things to do t start block demo
create a class for creating square, add properties like velocity and position

in the class constructor define a container for the fillRect method that takes in the properties you need

you may need to make custom functions that redraw the square everytime you change a value


create an array lsit of the square class so you can hold in the things

you will need an update method that will be ran by a timer every few milliseconds.


to check if a square has collided you need a nested loop that checks the objects sides, bottom and top and then reverses its velocity by multiplying the current velocity by -1
