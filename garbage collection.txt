garbage collection

in java, memory is automatically freed by deleteting unused objects

meaining when a object isnt referenced like the name of the object isnt used then it will be deleted and frees up some memory.

Java provides a mechanism called finalization. By using finalization, 
you can define specific actions that will occur when an object is just about to be reclaimed 
by the garbage collector.
To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the finalize( ) method. The Java run time 
calls that method whenever it is about to recycle an object of that class. Inside the finalize( )
method, you will specify those actions that must be performed before an object is destroyed. 
The garbage collector runs periodically, checking for objects that are no longer referenced 
by any running state or indirectly through other referenced objects. Right before an asset is 
freed, the Java run time calls the finalize( ) method on the object.
The finalize( ) method has this general form:
protected void finalize( )
{
// finalization code her
