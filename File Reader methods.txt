File Reader methods

read() reads the contents of a file as a stream of characters (the data type) one by one. it returns a int shcih contains the byte value.if tit returns negative 1 that means it has finished reading the file

read returns only one character each time so youd have to read it multiple times one thing you can do is use a while loop.

int data = reader.read();

while(data > -1){
//things to do with data like you can print it out on the same ine using print
data = reader.read()
the last line makes it read the next result and it keeps going unti the fie is done being read
}

ready() returns true or falso if the stream is ready to be read

make sure you turn the byte code into characters by casting
